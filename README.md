## DS4NP

This project was developed as part of my dissertation for my master's degree.
Until now this is my *magnum opus*. 
The objective of this project was to provide data science as a service (DSaaS) for non-programmers.
Users or external systems could create workflows similar to the ones seen in Weka, AzureML, Orange, H2O, etc...

The most challenging task for this project was the orchestration of workflows.
I was unable to share the code for this project. 
However, I share the architecture that I designed and implemented.

Duration 1 year.
## Condu

This is a python library that is used to interface with the orchestration engine **Netflix Conductor**.

Duration 264h.
