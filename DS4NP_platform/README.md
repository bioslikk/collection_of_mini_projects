# DataScience for Non-programmers
The architecture is a reflection of the functional and non-functional requirements previously identified.

The design patterns adopted is what is commonly referred as a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), more precisely a microservices one.

Choosing this pattern was a good choice, since its benefits were inline with the quality attributes that were established for this project.
Developing in this manner reduces many struggles of integrating each module of the system, eliminates restrictions such as programming languages, and provides better fault isolation.

The method of representation for the architecture seen in this folder is called **C4 model**.
